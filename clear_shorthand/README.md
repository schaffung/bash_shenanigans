# clear_shorthand

The idea is simple. Sometimes while working with BASH it becomes sort of annoying to type ```clear``` again and again even though one uses the TAB for autocomplete. The alternative thought upon is to encapsulate clear in a script called ```c```.

To let this take effect, please place this script inside ```/usr/local/sbin``` and give it executable permission.
